Begin a dolphin leg kicking underwater as your speed slows, maintaining the arms in front of you to begin the propulsive phase. Arm recovery should be vigorous, extending them out next to you to re-enter the water. Kick twice every arm cycle to drive the arms out of the water for recuperation and propel them back into the water. Breathing patterns can vary, but a common pattern is to breathe to the front with your shoulders leading the head above the water. Inhale rapidly through your mouth, drop your head before exhaling fast through the mouth and nose beneath the water, and re-enter the water with your head first, then your arms.",
